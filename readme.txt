== Description ==
The MooWoodle plugin is an extention of WooCommerce that acts as a bridge between WordPress/Woocommerce and Moodle. It fetches all the courses from your Moodle instance and makes them available for sale, which may be bought by users through WooCommerce. It reduces your effort by synchronising your LMS site with your online store. And when someone purchases a course from the store he/she is automatically gets registered for the course in the LMS site. More over this plugin works with WooCommerce subscription plugin too.

After the users receive the order-complete email, they need to click the link of the course or courses that they bought.

Alternatively, When someone buys a course, after the payment, he/she will be directed to a thank you page which normally contains the link of the my courses page.

On this page you will have all the courses listed that you have bought along with the links to the individual courses.

You will need to click on the links/buttons to get enrolled.
If you have bought a course and, the course is listed on that page but if the link is not displayed; then the payment is not verified yet. Once it is verified, the link will appear.

Note: You will need to click the purchased courses' links/buttons in the email body or on my course page in order to get enrolled.Then only you can use the ID and password to access your course on Moodle site.
